# Consumer-price-index

## Introduction :
    The Consumer Price Index (CPI) serves as a crucial economic measure, reflecting the average change in prices paid by consumers for goods and services over time. This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting CPI data across different sectors and categories using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. By employing ARIMA, a powerful time series forecasting technique, we aim to uncover trends, seasonality, and patterns in CPI fluctuations. Ultimately, this analysis will provide valuable insights into inflation dynamics, aiding policymakers, businesses, and consumers in making informed decisions regarding economic planning, budgeting, and investment strategies.

## Problem Statement :
1. To check the inflation rate.
2. Forecast the next 5 months CPI values.
